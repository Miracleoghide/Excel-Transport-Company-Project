### Project Brief
The demand for road transport is predicted to rise significantly, and Excel Transport will need to quickly grow its fleet to handle the increase in passengers. This is due to increase of flight prices which is making more people turn to road transportation. However, the Company can only double its fleet size due to limited resources. This project aims to maximize fleet expansion and optimize operations.   

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with determining how to achieve the goal of doubling the fleet size and prioritizing  routes. In addition, you are responsible for developing a detailed action plan for fleet growth and management, considering the following four key levers, all while operating within a resource-constrained environment.

As the project lead, you will review the four levers and create an actionable plan aimed at delivering maximum impact within the following timeframes:
I. Next Week    II. Next Month   III. Next 3 Months

**The four levers to increase fleet size**

1. Applications: We get 100 applications per month- driven by a combination of offline and  online sources.
2. Conversion: The conversion rate is ~30%, at the moment we are onboarding 30 drivers per month.
3. Engagement: Drivers complete 5 trips per week on average.
4. Churn: Roughly 10% of the fleet churns each month.

### Methodology and Tools used
1. **Understanding the Project brief and Data collection**: The first step is to review the project brief for a clear understanding of the goals, expectations and constraints. This include identifying KPIs, timelines. Once the brief is fully understood, Then we undestand the relevant data on fleet performance, customer demand, and operational metrics, which will serve as the foundation for further analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: The core of the analysis was done in excel. New columns were created to gain better understanding of the data and calculate important metrics. PowerBI was also used to create additional dashboard that provided interactive view of the data. These visuals helped identify key insights, track progress, and communicate findings more effectively to stakeholders
3. **Presentation**: Microsoft PowerPoint was used to give a presentation of the findings and action plans to the stakeholders
   
   **Tools Used**
   - Microsoft Excel for analyzing data.
   - Microsoft PowerBI for Visualation.
   - Microsoft PowerPoint for documentation and presenting findings.
   - Google Drive for sharing Document.
